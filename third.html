    <h1>Beautiful III.</h1>
    <p>Beautiful to me is not just based on sight alone; it incorporates all you are, what you take in and what you give off. Beauty grows with you, changes to your taste and your capricious whimsy, but it also grounds you and makes you realize that life is so much more vibrant because of it. Beautiful stirs your soul and quickens your pulse, moves you to tears and widens your pupils.</p>
