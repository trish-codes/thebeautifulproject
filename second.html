    <h1>Beautiful II.</h1>
    <p>How beautiful is that light shrouded in the darkness? No matter how bright or how dim, it still shines. That light is hope. That light is power. That light is love. People say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but no. True beauty cannot be seen, it is shared, received or experienced. In small gestures of kindness, friendship and love. All that is beautiful no matter how diminutive, frail, foreign, uncommon, strange or alien may be recognized not by its appearance, but by its transformative quality. Go ahead, watch true beauty move, and watch it turn a frown into a smile, turn an enemy into friend, turn cold to warmth, turn ignorance to empathy. All that is beautiful. No matter what. Shines....still.</p>
